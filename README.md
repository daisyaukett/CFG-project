# CFG-project
This is a project completed after an 8 week course on Python and Apps sponsored by Selfridges run by Code First Girls. The project involved learning how to manipulate and use APIs and creating a search engine for recipes from an ingredient and developing it further.

Here is the project brief:

Project Brief:Search

In this project you'll create a program to search for recipes based on an ingredient. The standard project uses the Edamam Recipe API, but can be changed to use a different API after completing the required tasks.
You will not need any additional knowledge beyond what is covered in this course to complete this project.

Required Tasks

These are the required tasks for this project. You should aim to complete these tasks before adding your own ideas to the project.
  1. Read the Edamam API documentation â˜… https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api
  2. Ask the user to enter an ingredient that they want to search for
  3. Create a function that makes a request to the Edamam API with the required ingredient as part of the search query (also included your Application ID and Application Key
  4. Get the returned recipes from the API response
  5. Display the recipes for each search result

I wrote the code for this project for my team including our chosen extension of asking how to customer would like to sort the recipes that have their chosen ingredient.
